- 👋 Hi, I’m @livgozdek
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics and developing innovative styles of metrics to measure things like cultural progress, social impact and joy!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "Intro to Computer Science" with ReDi school in Berlin and will then join a Data Science bootcamp!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that fuse the quantitive with the qualitative (I was trained as an Anthropologist)
